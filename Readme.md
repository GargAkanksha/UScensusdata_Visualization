# Interactive Plots Using D3

### Based on the latest information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, various health risks facing particular demographics have been analyzed.
### Points to note:
### 1. Using D3, a scatter plot has been created in which each state is represented by circles.
### 2. Both x-axis and y-axis contain multilabels with associated click events which gives users the flexibilty to choose between various factors affecting the lives of people.
### 3. There are tooltips associated with each state circle to display the data that the user has selected.
### 4. The chart/plot resizes according to the window size.
